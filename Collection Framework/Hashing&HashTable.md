✅ What is Hashing in Java?

> Hashing is a technique to convert a value (like a key) into a fixed-size number (called a hash code), which helps Java quickly find, insert, or delete elements — especially in `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable`.

---

🔑 Simple Definition:

> Hashing = Converting a key → into a hash code → to quickly find where to store/retrieve the value.

---

🧠 Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine a library where:

- Each book has a code number generated from its name.
- That code tells the librarian exactly which shelf to go to.

---

⚙️ How Hashing Works in Java (step-by-step):

Let’s say you’re using a `HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();`

```java
map.put(21, "Ravi");
```

Behind the scenes:

1. Java calculates a hash code from key `21`:
   ➤ `hash = key.hashCode()` → say it's `21`

2. It maps the hash to a bucket index in the internal array:
   ➤ `index = hash % capacity` → e.g., `21 % 16 = 5`

3. It places `"Ravi"` in bucket 5.

---

🔁 When you do:

```java
map.get(21);
```

Java does this:

1. Calculates `hashCode(21)`
2. Finds bucket index (`hash % capacity`)
3. Checks bucket 5 and returns `"Ravi"`

---

🔄 Collision Handling

If two keys give the same index (e.g., `hash % capacity` is the same), it's called a collision.

Java handles this using:

- Linked List (older versions)
- Balanced Tree (Java 8+ for large buckets)

---

🔧 Example in Java:

```java
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("India", "New Delhi");
map.put("USA", "Washington DC");

// Internally:
// "India".hashCode() → converts to some int → used to find bucket
```

✅ Summary:

| Term          | Meaning                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `hashCode()`  | Converts key into a number |
| Bucket        | Index in internal array    |
| Collision     | Two keys get same bucket   |
| Hash Function | Algorithm to generate hash |

💡 Where is hashing used?

- `HashMap`
- `HashSet`
- `Hashtable`
- `LinkedHashMap`
- `ConcurrentHashMap`

✅ What is a Hash Table in Java?

> A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs using a technique called hashing to make searching, inserting, and deleting operations very fast (almost O(1)).

---

🔍 Definition:

> A hash table uses a hash function to convert a key into a bucket index, where the corresponding value is stored.
> If two keys get the same index (called a collision), the data is handled using methods like chaining (linked list/tree).

---

💡 Java's `Hashtable` Class:

In Java, the class named `Hashtable<K, V>` implements a real hash table structure.

```java
Hashtable<Integer, String> ht = new Hashtable<>();
ht.put(1, "Apple");
ht.put(2, "Banana");

System.out.println(ht.get(1)); // Apple
```

🧠 Key Features of Java's `Hashtable`:

| Feature             | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Thread-safe         | All methods are synchronized (safe for multi-threading)            |
| No `null` key/value | Unlike `HashMap`, `Hashtable` doesn’t allow `null` as key or value |
| Legacy class        | Older than `HashMap`, mostly replaced now                          |
| Uses hashing        | Uses `hashCode()` to find where to store/retrieve data             |

---

⚙️ How a Hash Table Works (Simplified):

1. You add a key-value pair: `put(key, value)`
2. Internally:
   → `hash = key.hashCode()`
   → `index = hash % array.length`
   → Store value at that index
3. When you call `get(key)`, it uses the same hash to find and return the value.

---

🧪 Example:

```java
Hashtable<String, String> phoneBook = new Hashtable<>();
phoneBook.put("John", "9876543210");
phoneBook.put("Alice", "8765432109");

System.out.println(phoneBook.get("John")); // 9876543210
```

---

⚠️ Note:

- `Hashtable` is now considered legacy.
- For modern Java apps, use:

  - `HashMap` (faster, not thread-safe)
  - `ConcurrentHashMap` (thread-safe, non-blocking)

✅ Summary:

| Concept        | Value                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Data format    | Key → Value                                      |
| Speed          | Fast (O(1) average case)                         |
| Java class     | `Hashtable<K, V>`                                |
| Allows null?   | No                                               |
| Thread-safe?   | Yes                                              |
| Preferred now? | No (Use `HashMap` / `ConcurrentHashMap` instead) |
